## Visualization (plotting/)

master_Collector.py: Aggregates individual sample TSVs into one project-wide master file. It calculates global statistics and generates a high-resolution frequency distribution plot.

arg_mge_plotter_Map.py: Creates comparative genomic maps. It uses a tiered labeling system to ensure gene names don't overlap, making it ideal for visualizing complex clusters.

arg_mge_plotter.py: Generates standardized bar charts and histograms for individual samples, categorizing gene orientation as Upstream, Downstream, or Embedded.
