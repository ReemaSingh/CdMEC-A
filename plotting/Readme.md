## Visualization (plotting/)

```master_Collector.py``` : Aggregates individual sample TSVs into one project-wide master file. It calculates global statistics and generates a high-resolution frequency distribution plot.

```arg_mge_plotter_Map.py```: Creates comparative genomic maps. It uses a tiered labeling system to ensure gene names don't overlap, making it ideal for visualizing complex clusters.

```arg_mge_plotter.py```: Generates standardized bar charts and histograms for individual samples, categorizing gene orientation as Upstream, Downstream, or Embedded.

```OneHealthVisualization.py```:The visualization script transforms complex genomic coordinate data into high-resolution heatmaps and bar charts to visually map the conservation, redundancy, and physical architecture of resistance signatures across the One Health spectrum.
